# IIT Delhi Joins Inter IIT Tech Meet for the First Time!

Exciting news for all tech enthusiasts at IIT Delhi – we’re participating in the **Inter IIT Tech Meet** for the very first time!

It brings together 19 IITs and over 1500 students in a competitive yet collaborative environment, with the last edition hosted at IIT Madras.

The **Inter IIT Tech Meet** is designed to inspire participants to tackle real-world challenges by coming up with innovative technology-driven solutions. It’s not just about competition; it’s about fostering a community of like-minded individuals from across the country. You’ll have the opportunity to collaborate, network, and share knowledge with the best minds from other IITs while pushing the boundaries of technology.

This meet is a great chance to showcase our talents, solve impactful problems, and possibly transfer these solutions to ventures addressing grassroots challenges. Whether you're into AI, robotics, or software development, there’s a place for you at the Tech Meet.
